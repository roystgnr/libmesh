<a name="parallelmesh"></a><h2>ParallelMesh vs SerialMesh</h2>


<p>Unfortunately ParallelMesh may never be suitable for "general" use,
because the most general SerialMesh-using codes sometimes assume at
the application level that every process can see every element. If
your problem includes contact, integro-differential terms, or any such
coupling beyond the layer of ghost elements that ParallelMesh exposes,
then you have to do some very careful manual communications to make
that work on a distributed mesh.

<p>Because it is easier to use, SerialMesh is made synonymous with Mesh by
default.  For this reason ParallelMesh also receives less testing than
SerialMesh in user codes.
